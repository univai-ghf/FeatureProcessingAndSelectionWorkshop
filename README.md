# FeatureProcessingAndSelectionWorkshop

The aim of this workshop is to educate you about the handling of the feature variables that you will use in modeling machine learning models. This workshop comprises of knowledge rich lectures as well as practical hands on labs so that you ready to use what you learn.

The workshops is divided into four lectures and four exercises. As soon as you complete a lecture an intresting exercise awaits you. The itenary of the workshop is as follows:

Lecture 1: Forseeing Variable Problems When Building Machine Learning Models
